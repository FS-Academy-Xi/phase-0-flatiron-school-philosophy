# Welcome

Welcome to Flatiron School! We're thrilled that you've joined our community of
learners! 

The following content is designed for people who are passionate, curious,
self-driven, and serious about learning. We are comrades in a never-ending quest
for knowledge. While there are no shortcuts, we believe that by providing
knowledge in an optimized order, reinforcing knowledge with hands-on, feedback
driven practice, and providing space for discussion, you will learn quickly. Our
goal is to provide the right materials, support and structure _you_ need to
discover your own love for code.

## Learning to Write Code

This is the beginning of our Software Engineering course, where you will go
through everything from the basics of coding to building full-stack React
web applications.

So, where do we start? How do we know what is necessary to understand _first?_
In this course, we're going to start with a simple idea - programming is like
having a conversation, and just like learning to talk, we need to start by
learning a few words and practicing them.

Many people on joining Flatiron School have already spent some time dabbling
with coding by using the amazing and plentiful resources all around the
internet. In developing the content here, though, we make no assumptions. This
content is designed for absolute beginners. Lessons build off each other,
providing the tools and concepts necessary to complete future lessons.

What we don't do, however, is dumb anything down. We believe in your infinite
capacity to learn. We do our best to offer a curriculum that is clear,
digestible, engaging, challenging, and deep. The curriculum you'll encounter on
here is rigorous and will demand that you be patient and resourceful.

## The Flatiron Community

We don't believe in learning alone. As you make progress, expect to bump into
other learners just like you, ready and willing to help each other succeed.
Together, we can go further than we could ever go alone. We expect everyone here
to be friendly, respectful, helpful, and nice.

## Conclusion

The first part of this course will focus on getting your computer set up 
with the tools and software necessary for the rest of the curriculum. Then,
we will introduce some fundamental programming concepts. As you progress, you'll
start to use the tools on your personal computer to build projects and test your
knowledge. You're just getting started, and we're glad you're here.

Happy Learning!
